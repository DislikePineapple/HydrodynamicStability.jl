## Introduction

This is a package for solving eigenvalue problems of hydrodynamics stability system. 
The purpose of this package is to establish a lib include linear stability theory (LST), partial stability equations (PSE) and dirctly numerical system (DNS).

## Abstract type

This package uses the structure of [SciMLBase.jl](https://github.com/SciML/SciMLBase.jl) for the abstract type:

- Problem
- Algorithms
- Solution
- Function

Also, the code style follows SciML.
